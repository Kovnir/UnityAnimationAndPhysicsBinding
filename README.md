# Description

*UnityAnimationAndPhysicsBinding* - is attempt to make simple tool for blending animations with physic.

Unity - 2020.1

## What sholud be enhanced

* To make character stay in the place you need to ignore one bone, for example, hip and make its rigidboby Kinematic. It will allow the animation
* Joints should be set up depends on your animation. Movement of your animations will be not so intensive if it is not allowed by joints
* Physic will affect the doll, even if you will set all parameters to the maximum. So you will never have animations that look 100% as original
